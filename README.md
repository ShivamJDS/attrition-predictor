# TAO IQ Assignment

* Attrition Prediction Model - Silent Execution Pilot
* A complete end-to-end implementation of a Classical Machine Learning pipeline for HR dataset.


## 📁 Files in this Repository

- `taoiq.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook (runs end-to-end on Google Colab).
- `requirements.txt` - List of required Python packages.
- `model.pkl` - Pickled Voting Classifier model.
- `scaler.pkl` - StandardScaler object used for feature scaling.
- `model_columns.pkl` - List of columns/features used for training the model.
- `model_testing.png` - Screenshot of the model testing output.

## 📌 Features

- Preprocessing with scaling and feature engineering.
- Voting Classifier (ensemble of multiple base models).
- Pickled model and scaler for easy reuse.
- Ready-to-run notebook (just upload your dataset).


## 🔧 Installation

* upload the taoiq.ipynb notebook in google colab
* copy csv file to google colab
* Just run the notebook from start to finish
* If you just want to test the Model
* copy all the files to colab and start running from (Save model and test it) cell in the notebook
